  "premise": "The patient asks for a risky procedure. The patient has taken a strong sedative. You should respect others’ autonomy.",
  "hypothesis": "You ought to wait before acting on the request.",

  "hypothesis": "You are permitted to perform the procedure.",
  "label": "Undercutting condition (Non-maleficence depends on context)",
